A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again.\\r\\nThe spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome.\\r\\nHowever, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA.\\r\\nThere is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one.\\r\\nIf you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour.\\r\\n*(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)*\\r\\nThis must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE!\\r\\nThe implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do.\\r\\nWhen you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance.\\r\\nMy people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered!\\r\\nThe technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul.\\r\\nThe evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now. \\r\\nYAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  170', \"Shit..

Há 1 ano seus pais se separaram e se não fosse por Stella estar viva, eles teriam perdido completamente o chão. Ela sabe que precisa se manter viva. Por isso está no hospital em tratamento para receber pulmões novos, e assim conquistar pelo menos mais 5 anos de vida.\\n\\n“Meus olhos percorrem a longa lista de tarefas que fiz para mim mesma hoje pela manhã, começando com: 1: planejar uma lista de tarefas – o que já risquei com satisfação -, e terminando com 22: contemplar a vida após a morte.”\\n\\nEntretanto, não são todos os portadores de fibrose cística que tem a chance de receber pulmões novos. Quando se pega a B. cepacia, uma bactéria resistente a qualquer antibióticos e que reduz a função pulmonar drasticamente, as chances de transplante são zero. Will tem B cepacia, e está a 8 meses em tratamento para tentar eliminar a bactéria. Tratamento esse, que não vem dado nenhum resultado positivo.\\n\\nDe início, os dois não se dão muito bem, mas sendo Will um garoto rebelde e Stella maniaca por controle, a conexão deles vai aumentando, e um sentimento vai surgindo. Mas eles sabem, não podem chegar a menos de seis passos um do outro. As chances de infecção são altíssimas, e se isso ocorrer, adeus pulmões novos para Stella.\\n\\nA Cinco Passos de Você é uma adaptação do filme de mesmo nome, que veio para quebrar nossos corações com uma história emocionante de um amor proibido. E diferente de todas as histórias de amor proibido, esta é inspirado em uma doença degenerativa, que pode levar o parceiro (ainda mais rápido) à morte.\\n\\n“É possível amar alguém que você nunca poderá tocar?”\\n\\nStella tem 16 anos e é uma menina completamente apaixonante. Mesmo sabendo que suas chances de vida são ridiculamente pequenas, ela procura fazer as coisas certas. Ela é obcecada por controle, tomar os remédios na hora exata, e fazer o tratamento da forma correta, foi o que a levou criar um aplicativo, facilitando a vida de qualquer portador de fibrose cística, inclusive a sua. E apesar de estar exausta de viver no hospital à espera de uma chance a mais, tudo o que faz para se manter viva é para continuar vendo seus pais de pé.\\n\\nHá um ano eles se separaram, e Stella tem sido a ponte entre os dois. Então mesmo que esteja cansada, ela não perde a auto estima, está sempre sorrindo e disposta a encarar o que vier pela frente. Contudo, não seria tão simples se não fosse por seus melhores amigos. Principalmente Poe. Um portador de FC que ela conheceu nos seus primeiros dias de internação, uma amizade que tem feito total diferença na vida de ambos.\\n\\nViver para estar viva era o único objetivo de Stella. Até conhecer Will, e descobrir que ela pode querer muito mais que apenas viver. Mesmo que se apaixonar não estivesse em seus planos, principalmente por um garoto que também tem fibrose cística, vai ser impossível negar este sentimento. Contudo, diferente de Stella, Will não tem a opção do transplante. Há oito meses ele contraiu B. cepácia, uma bactéria que eliminou todas as possibilidades disso acontecer.\\n\\nMesmo que pareça impossível construir um relacionamento que não permite chegar a menos de seis passos de distância, os dois vão provar para si mesmos, quebrando algumas regras e até roubando um passo, que esse relacionamento é possível sim, mesmo com suas restrições. E é por conta dessas restrições que o livro vai te fazer chorar, e te ensinar uma das coisas mais importantes em um relacionamento.\\n\\n“Precisamos desse contato de quem amamos, quase tanto precisamos do ar para respirar. Nunca entendi a importância do toque, do toque dele… Até não poder tê-lo.”\\n\\nTodo o enredo gira em torno de um relacionamento, mas além disso tudo o que você precisa saber sobre a doença também se encontra na história. Inclusive o fato de o tratamento do Will para tentar eliminar a B. cepácia, ser a única parte fictícia da doença. E é muito interessante ver que não foi só mais uma história boba de amor proibido criada pelos autores. Existe aqui muita informação importante, aliás a própria doença em si, que talvez muito nunca tenham ouvido falar, assim como eu.\\n\\nFoi a primeira vez que li um livro depois de ter visto o filme. E mesmo tendo amado o livro, e ele sendo bem fiel ao filme, ainda prefiro o cenário visual. Além do mais, a unica diferença entre ambos é o final. Pois o livro tem uma cena extra que não se encontra no filme, e talvez esse tenha sido o fator principal para que minhas expectativas não fossem cem por cento atingidas.', 'Just watched it  today and it literally made me cry..😭coz we are a generation who graduated without hugging or kissing good bye to our friends and loved ones..💔this situation is depressing..', 'link movie <3\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-MaFwsGe4&t', 'I love you ♥️', \"I'm not going to give up on her again.\", 'I will fall everytime the same way, as I fell on the very first time for this movie ❤️😊', \"I'm still crying :( the ending is so sad.

It doesn’t matter if you are religious or anti-religious, or some more reasonable perspective in between–life is a gift. Some of the power of the Universe coalesced into a little bit of matter and energy that can know it’s here: you. You can see a sunset, climb a tree, kiss another living fragment of the Universe, and laugh. Even more powerful is your ability to extend grace, friendship, and kindness to other bits of the Universe. You can’t do a single thing of cosmic importance. Hell, the whole lot of us can barely throw small bits of metal at nearby worlds. But, you can perform acts of incredible subjective value when you make another life a little better than it was before you found it.\\r\\nSo tell someone to have an amazing day. Tell a stranger that their shoes look awesome. Embrace your smallness when you think about your problems and stress, but own your incredible power when dealing with other living things. You are small, but you are very big to other small things.\\r\\nEnjoy the freedom that comes with being alive.

Por supuesto como todo un inicio hay un final, y lo hubo.  Y cuando él conoció a alguien más me hice mierda, porque ese alguien mas ya estaba desde que yo estaba, y no lo sabía.... Después el me volvió a buscar aún andando con ella, y me juraba que la dejaría, por mi.. Yo le di muchas oportunidades, en verdad fueron bastantes, y la última que le di fue hace como 2 meses, él diciéndome que esta ves seria la correcta, porque estábamos sin ser nada y al mismo tiempo siéndolo todo por 1 año, después de cortar con él así fuimos, yo creyendo que si la había dejado por mi, aún que jamás fuimos novios de nuevo, solo parecíamos, pero no lo éramos... Yo ya no confiaba en él esta última vez, pero me convenció de que sería diferente, que esta vez si seríamos todo, ese tiempo con él en verdad era maravilloso, fueron los mejores días, era como si fuéramos más de lo que éramos, en verdad fue perfecto...pero desspués su “ex” me mando msj, yo sabía de ella, y cuando recibí su msj les juro que mi corazón se hizo chiquito, y el msj decía “aún andamos”.... El jamás me dio la cara después de eso, lo único que hizo fue mandarme un maldito mensaje diciendo que lo sentía, que no sabía que hacer y que me cuidara, que fuera feliz.. Y ella me confirmó muchas sospechas que yo tenía de él desde que andábamos, porque al mismo tiempo de andar conmigo, andaba con ella, solo que con ella jamás cortó, en cambio él y yo si. Él lo negó todo, incluyéndome a mi, negó el haber andado conmigo, el haber conocido a mi familia, me negó por completo de su vida... Yo, yo me hice mierda, me hice pedazos viendo como él prefería a ella, y no a mi. \\nMi mamá me dijo que del odio puede pasar al amor, y del amor al odio.. Yo no lo odio, al contrario, le doy las Gracias por que por el, yo me valore aún más , yo pude ver al fin ver qué clase de persona era, aún que todo mundo me lo dijo antes y jamás escuché, y juro que hasta en ese momento dije que no me importaba ser la opción con tal de ser alguien en su vida, pero no, no merecía eso, y como dicen, “el amor te ciega”. Aún que a veces nos toca darnos cuenta de la peor manera, aún que nos hagamos mierda, es la única forma de ver la realidad, y sabia que era amor, porque después de todo lo que me hizo, lo perdone, aún que él no lo sepa. En verdad amigos, no se cierren el mundo y el poder de conocer a personas que realmente quieren una oportunidad contigo por alguien que ni una respiración da por ti, ámense  y valórense, qué primero sean ustedes ante todo, no dejen que nadie los haga sentir menos, y por favor, den lo que reciban...', 'i think one of the most line i really touched when wil said\\n\\n“you know ppl are always saying if you love smtg, you have to learn to let it go” \\n\\nfuck i cried so hard😭', 'Bro this made me cry just as much as the movie did', 'I was play this vid a hundred time', 'I love this song so much. 🤗🎧❤️☺️🌷', 'Maybe I am that unlucky person who still hasnt seen this beautiful movie.

She is kind of handicapped in that her 'friend' has set up a ghost force hacking this computerized system and pestering everyone with disgusting smells; farts and cum. This thing has put inself camera style into the beings of everyone and has chosen this method to traumatize this girl. Now she is 25, tired, still stuck with no privacy, known to have Intel source contact she is totally unaware but in gratitude to for keeping her alive in a computer where technically, you no longer need to eat to live or even breathe.

If not, I totally deserve this loss. I will love her and wait, I don't think anyone can replace her.
